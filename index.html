<h2> What is a Trullo?</h2>

<p> A trullo is a traditional Apulian dry stone hut with a conical roof. Their style of construction is specific to the Itria Valley, <br> in the Murge area of the Italian region of Apulia. </p>


<p> There are many theories behind the origin of the design. One of the more popular theories is that due to high taxation on property, <br> the people of Apulia built dry stone wall constructions so that they could be dismantled quickly when tax inspectors were in the area.</p>
